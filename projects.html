    text="It started off with me just getting fed up with current music apps and wanting to make my own. I saw a lot of potential creating a modular music app similar to that of paperback, the reading app. Not only has it been a blast to create, but I've learned a ton about ios development while doing it. I'm currently working on getting a few more essential features in the app, but I think a TestFlight release this summer is more than reasonable.
    <br><br>2024.7.4 - Currently development is a bit stagnant. I've been losing a bit of motivation to work on the project, resulting in a recent hiatus. The project isn't binned, and even though there are other things I'd like to work on, I understand the value of this project in it's current state."
