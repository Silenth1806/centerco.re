    text="It started off with me just getting fed up with current music apps and wanting to make my own. I saw a lot of potential creating a modular music app similar to that of paperback, the reading app. Not only has it been a blast to create, but I've learned a ton about ios development while doing it. I'm currently working on getting a few more essential features in the app, but I think a TestFlight release this summer is more than reasonable.
    <br><br>2024.4.3 - Current state of development: Main thing left to implement is a search feature for sources, which is a bit of a tough cookie. Following that, I'd like to improve stability across the app. At that point, I'll let a few friends test it out, and if all seems well, I'll release it on TestFlight for a public beta. "

    text="I've wanted to do a game project for a long time, but each time I do it, I realize how much of a shithole I've dug myself into. In my sophomore year I tried to make a fucking triple a MMORPG. I look back and think what an idiot, and I'm sure my friends got a good laugh seeing me waste my time. <br><br> 
    Fast forward to today, my goal isn't to make something huge that's gonna blow up or anything, but I'd like to create a small-medium singleplayer game in the style of Mike Klubnika or Ville Kallio. "
